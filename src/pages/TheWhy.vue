<!--This is The Why component

  <div id="the-why">
    <h1>The why</h1>
    <p>
      It's so nice to share your kids advertures with the people you love,
      but most of the time this is through social media or whatsapp without any control
      and it's scattered all over the place.
      I wanted to create a platform in which you and your family and friends can share images,
      video's and adventures without having to worry about someone abusing it.
      Now the platform is based on my own daughter,
      but I would love to add extra layers so people can customize it,
      or control multiple Albums, so they are able to create an Album for each child.
